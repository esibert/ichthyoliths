# Welcome to this R script for calculating morphological disparity between
# dermal denticles or fish teeth. Note that while the general workflow for
# denticles and teeth is the same, the underlying trait matrices are completely
# independent for each microfossil type, and therefore denticles and teeth
# should be analyzed independently. You will be able to define which
# character coding scheme you are using within the R function.

# For Denticles you will use the traits and weights objects for denticles.
# The most recent versions are
# ichthyoliths::denticle_traits_v0.5 #trait matrices
# ichthyoliths::denticle_weights_v0.5 #weights for each trait

# The morphological disparity function (distances_clust) can take a long time
# and a lot of computing resources to run depending on the number of objects you
# are comparing. This is because it is calculating a pairwise distance between
# every single object in the dataset. The more objects, the more comparisons.
# Thus, I strongly recommend saving the calculated distances dataset as an .RData
# object and also as standalone .csv files (example code below). This will
# allow you to come back to these analyses and pick up where you left off rather
# than re-running the distances function. In a future version of this R package,
# I will have a "add objects" function, but at present, if you add objects to
# your datasets, you'll have to re-run the distances function in full.

##### General Workflow #####
# Step 0: Load the libraries
# Step 1: Call in the coded morphology matrix and define the columns which
#     contain numerical character state values. At this point you may also
#     clean up the dataset spreadsheet or define additional metadata columns
# Step 2: Run the disparity calculation (distances_clust function) and check for errors
# Step 3: Ordinate the distance matrix (NMDS) and save the ordination coordinates to the matrix
# Step 4: Plot the dataset!

#     Step 0: Set up the workspace     #
#                                      #
########################################

##### Libraries #####
# run this whole section every time, even if you've used a .RData file for disparity calculations
library(ichthyoliths) #For ichthyolith distance calculations and range chart
library(doParallel) #For calculating disparity efficiently using parallel computing
library(vegan) #for NMDS analyses
library(viridis) #for the range chart colors
library(rgl) #for 3D plotting - not necessary for functionality of the package, but very fun

# # To install the ichthyoliths package from Github, run the following code:
# library(devtools)
# install_github('esibert/ichthyoliths', force = TRUE) #force = TRUE overwrites any prior installation

#                                            #
#     Step 1: Call in the datasets           #
#             and specify the version of     #
#             ichthyolithMorph used          #
#                                            #

##### 1a. Define trait disparity matrices and define weights vector (or use defaults) #####
# The package has pre-loaded the traits and weights for denticle morphology v0.4 and v0.5.
# Note that for all future releases, the manuscript will specify the version used,
# and updated versions will be added as appropriate.

# If you want to define your own trait matrices or use this architecture to
# analyse an entirely different type of fossil, the way to import/organize the
# trait CSVs is included at the end of this script.

# ## Use the package-defined versions of the code (here using denticles_v0.5)
# you can either call this here, or you can call them directly in the distance function:
# traitset <- ichthyoliths::denticle_traits_v0.5
# weightset <- ichthyoliths::denticle_weights_v0.5

##### 1b. Import coded dataset #####

## Call in the dataset:
# If your dataset is directly from a file using our google drive template, skip the first line
dentdat <- read.csv('example_code/dentmorph_V0.5_Morphotypes.csv', skip = 1, header = TRUE, blank.lines.skip = TRUE)

## Figure out which columns hold the numerical data for the coded denticles. This will likely be the
# last 46 columns of the spreadsheet if you are using our google drive template.
# To confirm,
colnames(dentdat)
# This displays all the columns. We want columns 57 to 100 from this spreadsheet

## Which columns hold numerical coding data (e.g. A1-O10)
full_morphcols.morpotypes <- c(57:102) #should be 46 columns

#### Step 2a: run the distance function #####
dent_distances.morphotypes <- distances_clust(morph = dentdat,
                                              traits = denticle_traits_v0.5,
                                              weights = denticle_weights_v0.5,
                                              morphCols = full_morphcols.morpotypes,
                                              IDCol = 1,
                                              coresFree=2)

### Parameter explanations:
# morph is the coded matrix
# traits is the trait matrices, defined in the R package (as above) or you can pull in your own
# weights is the weights vector, defined in the R package (as above) or you can make your own
# morphCols are the columns that contain the morphotype code (this is defined above)
# IDCol is the column with the unique identifier for each object, usually a filename or
# coresFree passes to the doParallel loop and defines computing resources used.

# Note that the distances_clust function is also able to do sensitivity analyses
#  e.g. discount particular characters, upweight/downweight differently, etc.
#  If you are interested in using this feature to explore your morphospace,
#  please refer to the help file for the distances_clust function.
#  The function also can handle continuous trait values, though at present this is
#  not well-tested, so use at your own risk.

##### Step 2b: Turn the output of the distance function into a distance matrix for ordination #####


# make distmat
dent.distmat.morphotypes <- distmat(dent_distances.morphotypes, type = "avg")

# The distance calculation calculates disparity using two different methods:
#  Average disparity across all traits considered
#  Total disparity across all traits considered
# Where there are 0 values coded, those traits are not considered for those pairs
#  as is standard in such disparity analyses, and allows for effective cross-comparison
#  of broken ichthyoliths.
#  Thus typically we use the "average" rather than the "sum" values for further calculations
#  However, you may choose differently. Feel free to explore the distance calculation
#  output to see the different metrics calculated and how you want to handle them.


##### Step 2c (optional): Save the output so you don't have to re-run long disparity calculations #####
###  Distances calculation output dataframe
write.csv(dent_distances.morphotypes, file = 'example_code/dent_distances.csv', row.names = FALSE)

### Distance matrix
write.csv(dent.distmat.morphotypes, file = 'example_code/dent_distmat.csv', row.names = FALSE)
# Note that you should also set col.names = FALSE, or remember to include skip=1
#  when calling the distmat back in. For some reason R throws an error on my
#  computer (but not others) when including col.names = FALSE in the write.csv command.

##### Manually import trait CSV files and define weights #####

# names(weightset) <- names(traitset) #assign names to the weights vector to confirm correct order


# ##### Find coding errors #####
# # Troubleshooting: If you have any character state values that are out of bounds
# # (e.g. coded an "8" where there are only 6 character states), the distances_clust
# # function returns an NA value.
# # Since implementing the dropdown-menu based coding this has not been an issue, but this is how we
# # used to identify coding errors
# df.na <- subset(dent_distances.morphotypes, is.na(dent_distances.morphotypes$dist.sum))
#
# #list of objects that broke the function (if any): (I often use column 3, but the object IDs (column 8) are also good for this);
# # Correct issues and re-run the dat_distances function until this returns an empty object.
# unique(df.na[,8])
