Welcome to the "ichthyoliths" package, A package for calculating morphological disparity of fish teeth and denticles. At the current time (June 2023), the default version for tooth morphometrics is at v0.4 and denticles is at v0.5. Upon publication, both tooth and denticle version numbers will be updated to v1.0. Further updates will be documented accordingly. 

To download and use the R package, please use
devtools::install_github('esibert/ichthyoliths')

All functions have extensive help documentation. 

For details, help, and bug reports, please contact Elizabeth Sibert \email{esibert@@whoi.edu}.

This ReadMe is somewhat out of date, and will be updated upon publication of the tooth and denticle morphometrics papers in early 2025. In the interim, please see the dentmorph_v0.5_Example_code.R in the "example_code" directory for a tutorial on how to use the R Package.
